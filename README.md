This is a soon-to-be game that is currently comprised of what is simply an engine made from several extremely basic algorithms. 
Development has quite recently accelerated, and updates will be frequent as of October 11th. 

Currently, the engine runs using the MiniFB library.

This project has started near the beginning of June, 2025 and was converted into a repository roughly 4 months later.
It has started as an idea with quite the abundance of thought, and now it is being written in C.

More information will be provided in the near future.
